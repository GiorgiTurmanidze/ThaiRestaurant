                            Thai cooking places emphasis on lightly prepared 
                            dishes with aromatics and spicy heat. The Australian
                            chef David Thompson, an expert on Thai food, obser-
                            ves that unlike many other cuisines, Thai cooking is 
                            "about the juggling of disparate elements to create 
                            a harmonious finish. Like a complex musical chord 
                            it's got to have a smooth surface but it doesn't 
                            matter what's happening underneath. Simplicity isn't 
                            the dictum here, at all.

                            Traditional Thai cuisine loosely falls into four 
                            categories: tom (boiled dishes), yam (spicy salads), 
                            tam (pounded foods), and kaeng (curries). Deep-frying, 
                            stir-frying and steaming are methods introduced from 
                            Chinese cuisine.

                            In 2011, seven Thai dishes appeared on a list of the 
                            "World's 50 Best Foods", an online poll of 35,000 
                            people worldwide by CNN Travel. Thailand had more dishes 
                            on the list than any other country: tom yam kung (4th), 
                            pad thai (5th), som tam (6th), massaman curry (10th), 
                            green curry (19th), Thai fried rice (24th) and nam tok

                            Regional variations tend to correlate to neighboring 
                            states (often sharing the same cultural background and 
                            ethnicity on both sides of the border) as well as 
                            climate and geography. Northern Thai cuisine shares 
                            dishes with Shan State in Burma, northern Laos, and 
                            also with Yunnan Province in China, whereas the cuisine 
                            of Isan (northeastern Thailand) is similar to that of 
                            Southern Laos, and by Vietnamese cuisine to its east. 
                            Southern Thailand, with many dishes that contain liberal 
                            amounts of coconut milk and fresh turmeric, has that in 
                            common with Indian, Malaysian, and Indonesian cuisine.

                            In addition to these regional cuisines, there is also 
                            Thai royal cuisine which can trace its history back to 
                            the cosmopolitan palace cuisine of the Ayutthaya kingdom 
                            (1351–1767 CE). Its refinement, cooking techniques, pres-
                            entation, and use of ingredients were of great influence 
                            to the cuisine of the central Thai plains. 
                            Thai royal cuisine has been influenced by the Khmer royal 
                            cuisine through the Khmer palace cooks brought to the 
                            Ayutthaya Kingdom during its conquests of the Khmer Empire.
                            Thai royal cuisine has become very well known from 
                            the Rattanakosin Era onwards.

                            Typically, Thai royal cuisine has basic characteristics 
                            that are close to the basic food prepared by general 
                            people. However, Thai royal cuisine focuses on the freshness 
                            of seasonal products. Other than that, it is crucial that 
                            the way in which Thai royal food is cooked, should be complex 
                            and delicate.

                            La Loubère, an envoy from France during the reign of King 
                            Narai, recorded that the food at the court was generally 
                            similar to villager food. What makes Thai Royal cuisine 
                            different food is its beautiful presentation. For example, 
                            they served fish and chicken with the bones removed, and 
                            the vegetables were served in bite-sized portions. In addition, 
                            if beef is used, it should be tenderloin only.
